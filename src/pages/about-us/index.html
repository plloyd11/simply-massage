                            <p class="mb20">In 1985, Donald Jackson Sr purchased the company and changed the name to Omnitech Automation,
                                Inc. For 20 years prior to taking over Omnitech, Mr. Jackson had been employed by Mechanical
                                Services, Inc., an Allentown, PA manufacturer of automation equipment. In 1987, Mr. Jackson
                                relocated Omnitech to its current location in Emmaus, Pennsylvania.</p>
                            <p>In June of 2005, the company was purchased by its current owners, Fred Hafer Sr. and Fred Hafer
                                Jr. The Hafers retained all of OMNITECH’s existing employees, including Mr. Jackson, whose
                                40 years of automated equipment design and manufacturing experience make him a valuable asset.
                                Mr. Jackson, the company’s Executive Vice President, is responsible for automation concept
                                development.
