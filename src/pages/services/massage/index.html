        <h2>Benefits of Massage</h2>
        <p>We must learn to practice the art of slowing down &amp; getting back to the simple things in life. The most precious gift we have been given is our bodies. We must take good care & nurture ourselves as much as possible. When we do this regularly, it has a positive impact on our health (body), emotions (mind), & how we connect to the universe (spirit). When we give ourselves time to relax we are able to receive and enjoy more of life. The benefits of massage are many. Some of the most important being relief of stress, tension & fatigue, promoting a sense of relaxation, renewed energy and well-being. Massage also reduces muscle soreness, increases mobility & can bring relief to acute chronic pain. Incorporating it into your regular health routine can prevent injury & bring vitality to your life.</p>

            <h3>Simply Massage</h3>
            <p>Our highly trained massage therapists will conduct a pre-massage interview to customize a session that will address your individual needs. Modalities such as Swedish, deep tissue, NMT, hot stone and assisted stretching are offered.</p>
            <p>$190.00/120 mins (Most Popular.  Effective for treating chronic conditions, yet provides additional time for full body massage.)</p>
            <p>$135.00/90 mins (Allows time to treat chronic conditions, and possibly allows time for full body massage.)</p>
            <p>$95.00/60 mins (If you require a deep tissue session to address a specific area of concern -such as neck and back tension- OR full body relaxation. If you require a deep tissue session to address specific AND a full body massage, please choose the 120 min session. Deep tissue work is a slow process when performed correctly.)</p>

You can gain more awareness of your own body and develop a new relationship to your own health!</p>
