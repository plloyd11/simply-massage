            <h3>Rejuvenating Bliss</h3>
            <small>2 hours - $200</small>
            <p>The skin is exfoliated with a mineral rich Himalayan pink salt. Rest in our steamy wonder canopy and let the salt detoxify the body. Enjoy a cold stone facial and compress to enhance the senses. Finish with a luxurious Swedish massage with Bellabaci cups. The Bellabaci cups are used to release toxins from deep muscle and tissue by means of gentle suction. It has been found to affect the body up to four inches into the tissues, causing tissues to release toxins and inflammation, revitalize and oxygenate the skin. As toxins and inflammation are pulled from the body to the surface of the skin, the lymphatic system (which is stimulated by 300%) eliminates them.</p>
