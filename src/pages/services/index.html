                <h3>Repairs - Urgent Field Service</h3>
                <hr class="hr-content_horizontal">
                <p>Gone are the days when manufacturers maintained a significant inventory of the parts and products they sold. Today’s manufacturers operate in the fast-pace, low-inventory, quick-turnaround, just-in-time, Amazon-fulfillment world. This means that companies can’t afford several days of downtime. The automated equipment Omnitech develops needs to be operating at its designed performance levels all the time. Although some customers have automation-experienced, in-house resources to maintain and repair automated manufacturing equipment, many do not, so having a partner like Omnitech, that can provide 24/7/365 support, is critical. </p>

                <h3>Preventative Maintenance</h3>
                <hr class="hr-content_horizontal">
                <p>Today’s automated equipment includes a significant amount of sophisticated electronics and mechanical mechanisms. The maintenance and repair of this equipment can be complex and time-consuming. As an option for customers who don’t have experienced in-house technical resources, Omnitech provides preventative maintenance services. Whether it’s lubricating moving parts, replacing seals, adjusting belts or replacing commercial parts, Omnitech technicians are automation experts, trained to perform machine maintenance properly and efficiently. Omnitech also offers a <span class="txt-bold">WatchDog Preventative Maintenance Program</span> (P.M.I.) that puts all the responsibility of maintaining Omnitech equipment on Omnitech for the lifetime the equipment is in operation.</p>

                <h3>Watchdog P.M.I. Program</h3>
                <hr class="hr-content_horizontal">
                <p>OMNITECH's equipment is designed to guarantee many years of trouble-free operation. However, most manufacturing equipment needs to be adjusted and maintained periodically. Over time, a slow, subtle degradation in the equipment's performance can occur due to normal usage and wear. Left unaddressed, this can leave to serious performance issues or even machine downtime and costly repairs.</p>
                <p>To help customers keep their Omnitech equipment operating at its maximum performance levels, Omnitech offers its WatchDog Preventative Maintenance Program (P.M.I.). With the WatchDog program, Omnitech assumes the responsibility of maintaining a customer’s Omnitech-built automated equipment. Omnitech technicians visit the customer’s facility at set intervals (chosen by the customer) to inspect the equipment and provide a thorough report, detailing the technician's observations and recommendations. Any necessary repairs and maintenance can be performed by the customer or Omnitech.</p>
