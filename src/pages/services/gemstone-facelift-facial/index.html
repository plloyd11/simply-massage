            <h3>GuaSha Gemstone Facelift</h3>
            <small>90 minutes - $200</small>
            <p>This premiere facial may be found at high end spas (such as the  Manderin Oriental Spa) for upwards of $350. Now this  luxurious service is available at a fraction of the cost here at the Jersey Shore.</p>
            <p>GuaSha is a traditional Chinese treatment that has been touted for its incredible beauty and healing effects, namely in preventing and treating the signs of aging such as wrinkles, sagging, dark circles, and for promoting overall skin rejuvenation from the inside out. This precise technique and tool was developed by Dr. Ping Zhang. </p>
            <p>Our 90 minute gemstone facial starts on the back using massage techniques and hot stones to open the energetic flow and help the body to relax. Once the neck and shoulders are loosened we are ready to begin.</p>
            <p>Warmed towels soothe the tension lines from your face. A thorough cleansing with a pure, wholesome facial cleanser will soften the skin. This process cleans cellular debris and prepares the skin for Facelift. Using our gemstone tools made from selenite, agate, jade and rose quartz we perform a patented massage consisting of whipping, tapping, acupressure, GuaSha and contouring strokes. Lymph drainage, blood and oxygen flow is stimulated, energy lines are opened to nourish, rejuvenate and tone the muscles and skin of the face. The face is moisturized with pearl powder and hyaluronic acid to feed and nourish the skin.</p>
